Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player tries to sink the other's fleet of ships. Here are the standard rules of the classic board game:

🎯 Objective

Be the first to sink all of your opponent’s ships.

🎲 Setup

Each player has:

A 10x10 grid (labeled A-J horizontally, 1–10 vertically).

A fleet of 5 ships of varying sizes:

Carrier – 5 spaces

Battleship – 4 spaces

Cruiser – 3 spaces

Submarine – 3 spaces

Destroyer – 2 spaces

Each player:

Secretly places their ships on their own grid, either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.

Ships cannot overlap or go off the grid.

🚀 Gameplay

Players take turns calling out coordinates (like “B5”) to attack.

On your turn:

Call out a coordinate to attack.

Your opponent checks that coordinate:

If a ship is on that space, they say “Hit”.

If no ship is there, they say “Miss”.

You mark your tracking grid:

Use red pegs or an "X" for hits.

Use white pegs or an "O" for misses.

If a ship has all its spaces hit, it is sunk, and your opponent says “You sank my [ship name]!”

🏁 Winning

The first player to sink all five enemy ships wins.
